<div class="self-check-box">
<h3>Rules For Success</h3>

✓ Do this daily (consistency beats intensity)
✓ Start even if your partner isn't participating yet
✓ Be honest in your reflections (no one else will read this)
✓ Celebrate small wins (progress isn't linear)
✓ If you miss a day, just pick up where you left off

**What NOT to do:**
✗ Don't skip weeks (each builds on the last)
✗ Don't judge yourself for "failing" (awareness IS progress)
✗ Don't force your partner to participate (lead by example)

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Week 1: Awareness Phase

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>GOAL: Observe your relationship patterns without trying to change them yet.</strong>

Your report identified your pattern (Pursuer-Withdrawer, Manager-Employee, etc.).
This week, you're going to **SEE** it in action.

### Daily Practice (5-10 minutes/day)

Each evening, complete:

2.  **Mood Check** (How did I feel today?)
3.  **Connection Level** (Rate 1-10)
4.  **One Thing I Noticed**

*No judgment. Just observe.*

## What Happens After Day 30?

You've completed 30 days. Here's what to do next.

<div class="comparison-grid">
<div>
<strong>IF YOU'RE STAYING:</strong>
Continue the practices that worked:
*   Weekly check-ins
*   Daily touch (even 20-second hugs matter)
*   Monthly "State of Us" conversations

**Consider:**
*   Couples therapy (now that you know the pattern)
*   Re-reading your guides every 3 months
*   Repeating this workbook in 6 months
</div>
<div>
<strong>IF YOU'RE LEAVING:</strong>
Refer to: "Toxic Relationship Survival Kit" guide (if applicable)

**Remember:**
*   You save it a genuine 30-day effort
*   You made an INFORMED decision
*   You're allowed to choose yourself

**Next steps:**
*   Plan your exit
*   Tell ONE trusted person
*   Seek individual therapy
</div>
</div>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>IF YOU'RE STILL UNSURE:</strong>
That's okay. Clarity takes time.

**Consider:**
*   Extending the check-ins for another 60 days
*   Setting a firm decision deadline
*   Individual therapy to process confusion

**Ask yourself:** "If nothing changes in 90 days, will I be okay with that?"
</div>
