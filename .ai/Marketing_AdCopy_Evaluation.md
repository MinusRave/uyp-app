# Ad Copy Strategy Evaluation

## The Core Strategy
**"Pain Point Statement" → "Take the test → Make it make sense"**

### Verdict: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (Excellent)
This strategy is highly effective because it targets **Cognitive Dissonance**.
*   **The Hook:** The user is currently living in confusion ("Why is this happening?").
*   **The Promise:** You aren't promising "Love" or "Happily ever after" (which feels fake to someone in pain). You are promising **Sense** (Logic/Clarity).
*   **The Psychology:** When someone feels crazy/gaslit, they crave *reality testing* more than affection. "Make it make sense" is the perfect CTA for the "Malice Detective" or "Anxious" attachment style.

## Sentence Evaluation

I have categorized your lines by Tier based on emotional resonance and "scroll-stopping" power.

### 🚨 Tier S: The "Gut Punch" (High Virality)
*These stop the scroll because they describe the systemic loop perfectly. They feel like you are reading their mind.*

1.  **"I get loud because you get quiet."**
    *   **Why:** perfectly captures the Anxious-Avoidant trap. It validates the "loud" partner (who usually feels guilty) by giving a *reason* for their behavior.
2.  **"Little things become big fights."**
    *   **Why:** Universal. Every couple knows the "dishwasher fight" that turns into a divorce threat.
3.  **"I feel lonely even when you’re here."**
    *   **Why:** Deeply sad and relatable. Hits the "Silence & Distance" dimension hard.
4.  **"You hear me but you don’t listen."**
    *   **Why:** The #1 complaint in therapy. Instant validation.
5.  **"I don’t like being scared to talk."**
    *   **Why:** Hits the "Walking on Eggshells" feeling. Very vulnerable.

### ⚠️ Tier A: Strong & Clear
*Good for retargeting or carousel slides.*

1.  **"I talk and you don’t answer."** (Simple, factual).
2.  **"You walk away when I talk."** (Specific behavior usage).
3.  **"I try to fix it and it gets worse."** (Captures the "Pursuer-Distancer" failure).
4.  **"You think I’m mean / I think you don’t care."** (Great specifically for a "His vs Hers" split screen ad).
5.  **"I miss when we were happy."** (Nostalgia play).

### 📉 Tier B: A Bit Generic
*These might blend into other "relationship quotes" unless visually striking.*

1.  **"We fight about little things."** (Tier S version "Little things become big fights" is better because it implies *escalation*).
2.  **"Maybe we are both wrong."** (Too passive. People click because *they* are in pain, not to admit fault immediately).
3.  **"We don’t know how to talk to each other."** (A bit clinical).
4.  **"We need help to understand."** (Feels like work).

## Visual Strategy Recommendations (Canva)

Since the copy is stark/serious, the design should match.

### Concept 1: "The Text Message"
*   **Visual:** An iPhone text bubble (Blue or Gray) on a black background.
*   **Content:** The "One Liner" is the text message that was *sent* but *read 2 hours ago*.
*   **Caption:** "Stop waiting for a reply. Take the test → Make it make sense."

### Concept 2: "The Note"
*   **Visual:** An iOS Notes app screenshot or a messy handwritten post-it.
*   **Content:** "I get loud because you get quiet."
*   **Vibe:** Private, late-night thought. Intimate.

### Concept 3: "The Contrast" (Split Screen)
*   **Left Side (Black):** "You think I'm mean."
*   **Right Side (White):** "I think you don't care."
*   **Center:** "Who is right? Take the test."
