## 📅 Content Library

### Category 1: The "Truth Bombs" (Quote Cards)
*Visual Instruction: Centered text, large serif font. Author name "UnderstandingYourPartner.com" small at bottom.*

**Post 1**
*   **Visual Text**: "The fight is never about the dishes. It’s about 'Do I matter to you?'"
*   **Caption**: Next time you argue about chores, ask yourself: What am I really asking for? Usually, it's recognition, not a clean plate. 🍽️❤️ #relationshipadvice #couplestherapy
*   **Link**: Check your relationship patterns in bio.

**Post 2**
*   **Visual Text**: "A silent partner isn't 'uncaring'. They are often flooded and overwhelmed."
*   **Caption**: Silence is a protection mechanism, not a punishment. If they shut down, their nervous system is likely at capacity. Give them 20 minutes, then try again. 🧠🛡️ #avoidantattachment #love

**Post 3**
*   **Visual Text**: "Love is not enough. You need translation."
*   **Caption**: You can love someone deeply and still misunderstand their every signal. Learn the language of their nervous system. 🗣️👂 #relationshipgoals

**Post 4**
*   **Visual Text**: "Conflict is inevitable. Combat is optional."
*   **Caption**: You will disagree. That's healthy. But you don't have to destroy each other to be heard. 🛡️🤝 #conflictresolution

    [Icon: Stopwatch]
    FACT: Couples who wait 20 minutes to 'cool down' before resuming a fight are 30% more likely to resolve the issue.
*   **Caption**: It takes roughly 20 minutes for your body to flush out cortisol and adrenaline. If you try to talk before then, you're talking to a biological threat detector, not your partner. ⏲️⏸️ #scienceoflove
*   **Link in comments**: Take our biological compatibility test.

**Post 6**
*   **Visual Text**: 
    [Icon: Warning Triangle]
    FACT: "Criticism" is the #1 predictor of divorce.
    BUT... "Complaint" is healthy.
    Difference: "You are lazy" (Criticism) vs "I feel overwhelmed when the house is messy" (Complaint).
*   **Caption**: Watch your "You" statements. Turn them into "I" statements and watch the defense mechanisms drop. 📉📉 #gottman #communication

**Post 7**
*   **Visual Text**:
    [Icon: Brain]
    FACT: During an argument, your heart rate often exceeds 100bpm. At this point, you physically lose access to your prefrontal cortex (logic).
*   **Caption**: Literally "losing your mind". If your heart is racing, stop talking. You cannot be logical when you are physiological. 💓🛑 #nervoussystem

*   **Visual Headline**: Best Apology Style?
*   **Visual Option A**: "I'm sorry, I was wrong." (Admitting fault)
*   **Visual Option B**: "I understand why you felt that way." (Validating feelings)
