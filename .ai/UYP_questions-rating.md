All questions use a 1–5 Likert scale:

1 = Strongly disagree
2 = Disagree
3 = Neutral
4 = Agree
5 = Strongly agree

Some questions are reverse-coded.

4. Dimensions

Each area has:

Partner Model (PM): how the partner is perceived

Self Lens (SL): how the user reacts

Area	PM Questions	SL Questions
Silence	1,2R,3	4,5,6R
Conflict	7,8,9R	10,11,12R
Intentions	13,14R,15	16,17,18R
Reassurance	19,20,21	22,23,24R
Repair	25	26,27,28R
5. Scoring Method
Step 1 – Normalize

Likert 1–5 → 0–1
(value - 1) / 4
Reverse: 1 - normalized

Step 2 – Dimension Score

For each dimension:

PM score = average(PM questions) × 100
SL score = average(SL questions) × 100

Step 3 – Mismatch

Mismatch = | SL – PM |

Interpretation:

0–14 = aligned

15–34 = latent tension

35+ = high misunderstanding risk

Step 4 – Dominant Lens

The dominant lens is:

The dimension with highest SL

And meaningful mismatch

This becomes the main theme of the report.

Step 5 – Misread Risk

Activated when:

SL is high

PM is low

Example:
High need for reassurance + low perceived expressiveness
→ Risk of reading distance where there is difference in style.

6. Report Structure

Explains:

What activates the user emotionally

What they unconsciously look for

How they tend to read signals

What the user reads accurately

Why it works

3. Likely Misreads

High-mismatch areas:

What happens inside the user

What they may attribute to the partner
