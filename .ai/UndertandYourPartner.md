UnderstandYourPartner.com
Executive & Conceptual Definition (AI Instruction Document)
1. What UnderstandYourPartner.com Is

UnderstandYourPartner.com is a psychology-inspired digital project focused on helping people better understand their romantic relationships by examining how they interpret their partner’s behavior, rather than attempting to define or diagnose the partner.

The core idea is simple but powerful:

Most relationship conflicts are not caused by what the partner does,
but by the meaning we assign to what they do.

UnderstandYourPartner.com exists to make those meanings visible.

The project does not provide therapy, diagnoses, or clinical assessments.
It does not label partners or assign blame.
Instead, it helps users develop self-awareness, emotional clarity, and a more accurate understanding of relational dynamics.

2. The Problem It Addresses

In many relationships, recurring issues arise from misinterpretation:

silence is read as emotional distance

conflict is read as rejection

lack of reassurance is read as lack of care

These interpretations are often shaped by:

personal emotional needs

sensitivity to uncertainty

past relational experiences

individual communication styles

Most online relationship content oversimplifies these dynamics, offering:

rigid labels

one-sided blame

generic advice

UnderstandYourPartner.com addresses this gap by focusing on interpretive patterns, not surface behaviors.

3. Core Value Proposition

UnderstandYourPartner.com helps users:

recognize their own interpretive lens

understand how their needs influence perception

identify where misunderstandings are likely to occur

distinguish between difference in style and actual relational problems

The value lies not in telling users what to do, but in helping them see why they react the way they do, and how that shapes the relationship.

4. The Central Product Concept: The Test

The main experience is a structured psychological test designed to reveal:

Partner Model (PM)
How the user perceives and interprets their partner’s behavior.

Self Lens (SL)
How the user personally reacts to ambiguity, conflict, reassurance, and emotional distance.

The test does not claim to describe the partner’s true personality.
It explicitly measures the user’s interpretation of the partner and the user’s internal reactions.

5. Question Design Philosophy

The test consists of 28 fixed questions, designed to be completed in approximately 10–12 minutes.

Question Types

Likert scale questions (Strongly disagree → Strongly agree)

Questions are emotionally safe, non-judgmental, and non-clinical

Two Categories of Questions

Partner Model questions (PM):
“How do you interpret your partner’s behavior?”

Self Lens questions (SL):
“How do you personally react in relational situations?”

This dual structure is essential.
Value emerges from the comparison between PM and SL, not from either alone.

6. Psychological Dimensions Measured

The test measures five core relational dimensions, each evaluated separately for PM and SL:

Silence & Distance
How silence is interpreted vs. how silence affects the user emotionally.

Conflict & Tension
How disagreement is perceived vs. how the user reacts to conflict.

Intention Attribution
Whether behaviors are interpreted as intentional or given the benefit of the doubt.

Need for Reassurance
The user’s need for explicit reassurance vs. perceived partner expressiveness.

Repair & Closure
Expectations around emotional repair and closure after conflict.

These dimensions are non-diagnostic and framed as relational tendencies, not traits.

7. Scoring Logic (Conceptual, Non-Technical)

All scoring is deterministic, transparent, and explainable.

Step 1 – Dimension Scores

Each dimension produces:

a Partner Model score (PM): how the partner is perceived

a Self Lens score (SL): how the user reacts

Scores are normalized on a 0–100 scale for clarity.

Step 2 – Mismatch Analysis

For each dimension, the system calculates a Mismatch Score:

the absolute difference between SL and PM scores

This highlights areas where:

the user’s emotional needs

and the perceived partner style

may be out of sync.

Mismatch is interpreted as:

low mismatch → alignment

medium mismatch → latent tension

high mismatch → high risk of misunderstanding

Step 3 – Interpretive Risk Patterns

Certain combinations of scores activate misinterpretation risks, such as:

reading emotional distance where there may be processing

interpreting conflict as rejection

assuming negative intent under stress

These are presented as tendencies, never as facts.

8. Report Structure & Output Philosophy

The full report is structured around clarity, not instruction.

Report Sections

Your Primary Interpretive Lens
The dominant way the user tends to interpret relational signals.

Where You Likely Understand Your Partner Well
Areas of alignment and accurate interpretation.

Likely Misreads
Where perception may be distorted by emotional needs or expectations.

Recurring Misunderstanding Loops
Typical patterns where the same conflict repeats with different triggers.

Three Practical Reflections / Actions

one observation to notice

one communication shift

one self-regulation focus

The report avoids:

blame

directives

moral judgment

It aims to foster insight and agency.

9. Optional AI Commentary (Guided Reflection Only)

An optional AI-generated commentary may be added on top of the deterministic report.

Its role is strictly limited to:

summarizing insights in empathetic language

suggesting reflective questions

encouraging curiosity rather than certainty

The AI must:

never diagnose

never label the partner

never claim objective truth

never replace the core deterministic logic

If AI commentary is unavailable or fails, the core report remains complete and sufficient.
