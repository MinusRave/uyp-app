# UnderstandYourPartner - Business Documentation

## Executive Summary
**UnderstandYourPartner** is a direct-to-consumer online psychological assessment platform. It helps individuals and couples decode their relationship dynamics through a 10-minute test. Instead of generic advice, users receive a personalized "User Manual" for their partner's nervous system, generated by an advanced AI that acts as an objective third-party therapist.

## The User's Why: Driver & End Game
To understand the business, we must understand the user's state of mind. They are not taking this test for "fun"; they are taking it out of **exhaustion**.

### The Driver (Why they click "Start")
The user is stuck in a circular conflict loop. They feel:
*   **Invalidated:** "I keep explaining myself, but they don't get it."
*   **Crazy:** "Am I too sensitive? Is my reality wrong?"
*   **Desperate:** "This is my last attempt to fix this before I give up."
*   **The Hope for Vindication:** They secretly want an objective source to say, "You are right, and here is the scientific proof."

### The "End Game" (The Ultimate Benefit)
What is the user actually buying? It isn't just "understanding"—it is **Emotional Safety and Control**. By paying $15, they acquire a predictable mechanism to interact with their partner.
*   **Relief from Chaos:** The partner's behavior changes from "malicious and random" to "predictable and biological."
*   **The "User Manual":** A concrete tool to stop the pain. "If I say X, they panic. If I say Z (as the app suggests), they stay calm."
*   **Peace:** The ultimate ROI is the silence of a fight that *didn't* happen.

## Value Proposition
- **"Cheaper than 5 minutes of therapy":** Immediate, accessible relationship clarity without the high cost or wait times of counseling.
- **Objective Vindication:** Moves couples from "he said, she said" arguments to data-driven discussions.
- **Privacy First:** We don't sell data; we sell clarity. Results are encrypted and private.
- **Instant Implementation:** Provides actionable scripts and "repair attempts" that can be used immediately to de-escalate conflict.

## Product Flow & Business Model
The application follows a "Test -> Teaser -> Paywall -> Value" model:

1.  **The Assessment (Free):** Users answer 28 psychometric questions designed to measure their emotional reactions and interpretations.
2.  **The Teaser (Free):** Users see high-level insights, such as their "Dominant Lens" (e.g., "Amplified Distress") and key trigger points, but the actionable advice is locked.
3.  **The Unlock (Monetization):** Users pay a **one-time fee of $15.00** to unlock their full report.
4.  **The Deep Mirror (Product):** Access to the full, AI-generated analysis, scripts, and compatibility breakdown.

## Methodology & Technology
The core of the product combines established psychological theory with modern AI.

### 1. The 5 Core Dimensions
The assessment measures users across five critical relationship dimensions:
1.  **Silence & Distance:** How one interprets and reacts to a partner's need for space (e.g., Secure vs. Abandonment Anxiety).
2.  **Conflict & Tension:** Tolerance for unresolved arguments (e.g., Avoider vs. Urgent Resolver).
3.  **Intentional Attribution:** The tendency to view a partner's actions as malicious vs. accidental (Benefit of Doubt vs. Malice Detective).
4.  **Reassurance Need:** The level of verbal validation required to feel loved (Self-Assured vs. Validation Hungry).
5.  **Repair & Closure:** The ability to "let go" after a disagreement (Quick Eraser vs. Lingering Resentment).

### 2. The Quadrant System Algorithm
Answers are scored not just on a linear scale but mapped onto a **Quadrant System** based on two axes:
-   **Sensitivity Level (SL):** Biological/Emotional reactivity to the trigger.
-   **Perception of Malice (PM):** Cognitive interpretation of the partner's intent.

This categorization (e.g., *Amplified Distress, Detached Cynicism, Self-Regulation, Secure Flow*) allows for highly specific diagnosis of *why* a conflict occurs—is it biological panic or a trust issue?

### 3. AI "Deep Mirror" Analysis
Upon payment, the system uses **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** (via Anthropic API) to generate a personalized "Executive Analysis". This is not a static template. The AI acts as a senior therapist, analyzing:
-   The user's specific dimensional profile.
-   Relationship context (duration, children, marriage structure).
-   A specific recent conflict description provided by the user.

The output acts as a compassionate but direct "Mirror," explaining exactly how their nervous system is sabotaging their connection and providing a specific script to fix it.

## Target Audience
-   **Couples in Crisis:** Partners looking for a "last resort" or immediate clarity who are tired of circular arguments.
-   **The "Misunderstood" Partner:** Individuals who feel their partner "just doesn't get" why they react the way they do.
-   **Introspective Individuals:** Users wanting to understand their own patterns ("Why do I always panic when he's silent?") before bringing it to the relationship.

## Pricing
-   **Full Report Unlock:** **$15.00** (One-time payment).
    -   Includes: Full Dimensional Analysis, "Deep Mirror" AI Letter, Conflict Decoder, and Actionable Scripts.
