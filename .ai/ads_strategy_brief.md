# Ad Strategy: The "5-Dimensional Diagnostic" Campaign

**The Core Concept:**
Stop selling a "General Relationship Fix".
Start selling a **"Specific Symptom Diagnosis"**.
Users click because they feel a *specific* pain. The Landing Page then validates that pain and offers the full MRI.

## Angle 1: Physical Intimacy (The "Roommate" Trap)
*Targeting: "Roommates" Card on Landing Page.*

*   **Hook (Visual):** A couple sitting on a couch, phones out, miles apart emotionally.
*   **Headline:** "When did you become roommates?"
*   **Body Copy:**
    > "You function perfectly as a team. You pay the bills, feed the kids, and manage the house. But the spark? Gone. 
    > You aren't fighting. You're just... drifting.
    > 
    > It's not 'just a phase'. It's a specific biological loop called **The Intimacy Mismatch**.
    > 
    > Stop guessing why they pulled away. Run the diagnostic."
*   **CTA:** "Decode Your Intimacy Pattern (Free)"

## Angle 2: Emotional Safety (The "Brick Wall" / Silence)
*Targeting: "The Wall" Card on Landing Page.*

*   **Hook (Visual):** One partner pleading/talking, the other looking away/shut down.
*   **Headline:** "Silence is not peace. It's a scream."
*   **Body Copy:**
    > "When they go silent, you panic. You ask 'What's wrong?' and they say 'Nothing.'
    > 
    > You think they don't care. Actually, they are flooded. They have hit **'Sensory Overload'**.
    > 
    > If you keep pushing, they will break. If you walk away, you feel abandoned.
    > 
    > Find the exact script to break the silence without triggering the shutdown."
*   **CTA:** "See Why They Go Silent"

## Angle 3: Communication (The "Explosion" / Same Fight)
*Targeting: The Hero Section ("Same Fight").*

*   **Hook (Visual):** A visibly exhausted face (POV).
*   **Headline:** "Why do you keep having the same fight?"
*   **Body Copy:**
    > "It starts with the dishes. Then it becomes about 'respect'. Then it ends with 'Maybe we shouldn't be together.'
    > 
    > It’s a **Biological Trap**. Your nervous system is hijacking the conversation before you even speak.
    > 
    > 15,000 couples have broken the loop. It takes 10 minutes to see the pattern."
*   **CTA:** "Map Your Conflict Loop"

## Angle 4: Power & Fairness (The "Parent-Child" Dynamic)
*Targeting: "The Eggshells" Card.*

*   **Hook (Visual):** Someone looking at a long to-do list, exhausted.
*   **Headline:** "Stop parenting your partner."
*   **Body Copy:**
    > "You carry the mental load. You remember the birthdays. You plan the meals.
    > 
    > And when you ask for help, they say: 'You should have just asked.'
    > 
    > This isn't about chores. It's about **The Fairness Gap**. And it kills relationships faster than cheating.
    > 
    > valid_date your exhaustion with data."
*   **CTA:** "Measure The Mental Load"

## Angle 5: Future & Values (The "Drift")
*Targeting: The "Trajectory" Report Section.*

*   **Hook (Visual):** Two paths diverging in a wood (Abstract).
*   **Headline:** "Are you growing together? Or just growing old together?"
*   **Body Copy:**
    > "You love them. But you look at the future and see two different movies.
    > 
    > Different ambitions. Different spending habits. Different dreams.
    > 
    > Don't wait for the mid-life crisis to find out if you're compatible.
    > 
    > Check your **Future Alignment Score** today."
*   **CTA:** "Check Compatibility Score"

## Performance Notes
*   **Creative:** Use "Lo-fi" iPhone photos (authentic) over stock photos.
*   **Format:** These work best as Stories (Poll format: "Do you feel heard? Yes/No") or Feed Image Ads.
*   **Scent Trail:** Ensure the Landing Page "Mirror" section is visible immediately (The "Does this sound like you?" section matches these ads perfectly).
