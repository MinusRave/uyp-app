## Introduction

If you're reading this, you already know something is wrong.
Your gut is telling you something is OFF. You just can't prove it.

**This guide will give you the proof.**

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Overt vs. Covert Narcissism</strong>
<strong>Overt:</strong> Arrogant, loud, demanding. Easy to spot.
<strong>Covert:</strong> Plays victim, passive-aggressive, "sensitive". Hidden and dangerous.
</div>

**Why Covert is more dangerous:**
They hide behind vulnerability. They make YOU feel like the abuser.

## Part 2: Scoring Your Results

<div class="comparison-grid">
<div>
<strong>0-5 Checks: probably safe</strong>
Relationship has issues, but likely not narcissism.
</div>
<div>
<strong>6-12 Checks: Toxic Territory</strong>
Narcissistic traits. Likely won't change. 80% eventually leave.
</div>
</div>

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>13+ Checks: DANGER ZONE (High Probability NPD)</strong>
* They won't change.
* Therapy won't work.
* Staying = Psychological harm.
</div>

## Part 3: What To Do (If Score is 13+)

### Step 1: Accept Reality
You cannot love them into changing. This is a THEM problem.

### Step 2: Stop Explaining
Do NOT show them this list. They will just gaslight you.
Save your energy.

### Step 3: Build Exit Plan
See "Toxic Relationship Survival Kit."
* Separate money.
* Document abuse.
* Tell one trusted person.
* Leave quietly.

<div class="callout-final">
<strong>The Hardest Truth</strong>
Narcissism is a personality disorder. It is ego-syntonic (they think they are right).
You cannot fix them.
<strong>You can only save yourself.</strong>
