# Should I Stay or Should I Go?
<div class="subtitle">The Clinical Decision Matrix (No More Guessing)</div>

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Introduction: You're Stuck in the Worst Place

**Not bad enough to leave.**
**Not good enough to stay.**

You're in **limbo**—the most painful relationship state.

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Why limbo is torture:</strong>
Because you can't plan.
You can't move forward.
You can't grieve.
You're frozen.
</div>

**This guide will get you UNSTUCK.**
Not by telling you what to do—but by giving you a **FRAMEWORK** to make the decision yourself.

<div class="page-break"></div>

## Part 1: Why You Can't Decide

### Reason #1: Sunk Cost Fallacy

<div class="example-box">
"I've already invested 5/10/15 years. I can't throw that away."
</div>

**Why it's a trap:**
Past investment is IRRELEVANT to future happiness.
Time already spent doesn't justify MORE time wasted.

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Reframe:</strong>
"If I met them TODAY, knowing what I know now, would I choose this relationship?"
If the answer is NO, the years already invested don't matter.
</div>

### Reason #2: Fear of Being Alone

<div class="example-box">
"What if I never find someone else? What if I die alone?"
</div>

**The truth:**
Being ALONE is better than being LONELY in a relationship.
Most find new partners within 2 years. Even those who don't report being HAPPIER alone.

### Reason #3: Hope They'll Change

<div class="example-box">
"If I just give them more time... If I just love them harder..."
</div>

**Test:**
How long have you been hoping they'll change?
* 6 months? Keep trying.
* 1 year? Set a deadline.
* 2+ years? They're not changing.

### Reason #4: Guilt

<div class="example-box">
"They need me. They'll be devastated. What about the kids?"
</div>

**Why it's a trap:**
You're not responsible for their happiness. Kids are better with separated happy parents than together miserable ones.

At the end: Either progress is visible (State 2) or nothing changed (State 4).
No more limbo.
</div>

### Week 1-2: State Your Needs Clearly
Most people in stagnant relationships have NEVER clearly stated their needs. They've hinted.
**Sit down and say:**

<div class="example-box">
"I need to be honest. I'm not happy. I want to give us 90 days to fix this. Here's what I need from you: [List 3-5 Specific Needs]"
</div>

### Week 3-8: Execute & Document
1. Follow the protocols (communication, intimacy).
2. Document progress daily.
3. Weekly check-ins.

### Week 9-12: Reassess
**Sit down at Day 90 and ask:**
1. Did they honor your needs?
2. Do you feel DIFFERENT?
3. Can you see a FUTURE?

<div class="highlight-box">
<strong>Decision Time:</strong>
If PROGRESS: <strong>STAY</strong> and continue working.
If NO CHANGE: <strong>LEAVE</strong>. You have your answer.
</div>

<div class="callout-final">
<strong>Being "DONE" IS A Reason</strong>
You don't need a "good enough" reason to leave.
"I don't want this anymore" is a complete sentence.
Sometimes leaving is the brave choice.
</div>
