# Landing Page Strategy: The "Empathy + Authority" Approach

**The "Old" Strategy:** "Relationship MRI" (Too Cold/Clinical)
**The "New" Strategy:** "We Know Exactly How Lonely You Feel" (Empathy + Solution)

## 1. The Core Psychology
The user is not looking for a "Report." They are looking for **Validation** and **Relief**.
They feel "crazy," "unheard," and "stuck."
Our job is to:
1.  **Validate:** "You aren't crazy. Here is exactly why you feel this way."
2.  **Translate:** "Your partner isn't ignoring you; they are overwhelmed."
3.  **Resolve:** "Here is the map to fix it tonight."

## 2. The Narrative Arc (Section by Section)

### Section 1: The Hero (The "3 AM Thought")
*   **Headline:** "The fight is never about the dishes. It's about 'Do I matter to you?'"
*   **Subhead:** "Stop the cycle of misunderstanding. Decode the hidden emotional pattern driving your conflict in 10 minutes."
*   **CTA:** "Start Free Analysis" (Low friction).
*   **Visual:** Emotional warmth, not just cold data.

### Section 2: The "Mirror" (Validation)
Instead of generic "features", we list the *exact* pain points they feel:
*   "You explain yourself for hours, but they still don't get it." (Communication)
*   "You feel alone even when you're sitting right next to them." (Intimacy)
*   "You carry the mental load for everything." (Fairness)
*   **The Hook:** "Does this sound like you? We know why."

### Section 3: The "Map" (The Solution)
We explain the *value* of the report, not the specs.
*   **Feature:** "32-Question Logic" -> **Benefit:** "A diagnostic deeper than therapy."
*   **Feature:** "AI Analysis" -> **Benefit:** "The exact script to break the silence."
*   **Feature:** "Partner Profile" -> **Benefit:** "Finally understand their side."

### Section 4: The Urgency (The "Fork in the Road")
*   "The groove gets deeper every time you have the same fight."
*   "68% of couples in this loop hit a breaking point within 18 months."
*   "Don't let resentment calcify into indifference."

### Section 5: The Offer (Risk Reversal)
*   "Cheaper than the takeout you order to comfort yourself after a fight."
*   "100% Money Back Guarantee: If you don't feel 'seen', you don't pay."

## 3. Key Copy Changes

| Clinical Term | Empathetic Term |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Dominant Lens" | "Your Hidden Trigger" |
| "Sensory Load" | "Why You Panic" |
| "Analysis" | "The Answer" |
| "Report" | "User Manual for Your Partner" |

## 4. Execution Plan
*   **Tone:** Warm, authoritative, direct ("Truth Bombs").
*   **Colors:** Warm creams/process blues, but with sharp typographic hierarchy.
*   **Structure:** Flow from Pain -> Epiphany -> Solution.
