## PERSONALIZED TEASER SECTION

### Intro
Based on your answers, we've identified your relationship's **dominant pattern**.

### Dynamic Content Block (Personalized)

> **Your Relationship Status:** {{RELATIONSHIP_STATUS}}  
> *(Stable but Stuck / In Crisis / Stalled / Healthy)*
> 
> **Your Conflict Pattern:** {{CONFLICT_PATTERN}}  
> *(Pursuer-Withdrawer / Silent Treatment / Mutual Escalation / Manager-Employee)*
> 
> **Your Biggest Vulnerability:** {{TOP_METRIC}}

> *(The Anxious Pursuer / The Manager / The Safety-Starved Partner / The Burnt-Out Caregiver)*

### Hook
**You felt something was wrong. Now you know WHAT it is.**

But knowing the name of the problem isn't enough.

You need to know:
- **WHY** this pattern started in the first place
- **WHAT** triggers it every single time
- **WHERE** it's taking you (6 months from now, 5 years from now)
- **HOW** to break the cycle before it breaks you

That's what the complete analysis gives you.

## MIRROR EFFECT SECTION (Identification)

### Headline
**"Does This Sound Familiar?"**

### Symptom Checklist

Based on your answers, you're probably asking yourself:

#### ☑️ "Am I the crazy one?"
*They tell you you're too sensitive, that you're overreacting. But you KNOW something's wrong. You can feel it in your body—the tension, the walking on eggshells, the constant second-guessing.*

#### ☑️ "Why do they keep rejecting me?"
*Every time you reach for connection—physical, emotional, any kind—they pull away. And every "not tonight" or turned back feels like a rejection of YOU, not just the moment.*

#### ☑️ "Why do I have to do EVERYTHING?"
*You're the one remembering appointments, planning life, carrying the mental load. You feel like their parent, not their partner. And you can't remember the last time they anticipated YOUR needs.*

#### ☑️ "Have we become roommates?"
*You talk about groceries, bills, whose turn it is to take out the trash. But you haven't talked about YOUR RELATIONSHIP in months. You coordinate logistics. You don't connect.*

#### ☑️ "Is this fixable, or am I just delaying the inevitable?"
*You don't know if you're fighting for something worth saving or just scared to let go. You're stuck between "try harder" and "give up." And every day that passes without clarity feels like a day wasted.*

#### ☑️ "Why does the same fight keep happening?"
*Different trigger, same outcome. You could script it. You know exactly how it's going to go, but you can't seem to stop it.*

#### ☑️ "Do they even love me anymore?"
*You see them light up for their friends, their hobbies, their phone. But with you? Nothing. You're the obligation, not the desire.*

### Validation Statement
**You're not imagining it.**  
**Your relationship HAS a pattern.**

And that pattern has a name. A structure. A predictable trajectory.

The problem isn't that you're broken—it's that you're stuck in a SYSTEM.

**Your complete analysis doesn't just name the pattern.**

It shows you:
- **EXACTLY** how the cycle works (step-by-step breakdown)
- **WHY** your repair attempts fail every single time
- **WHAT** this pattern is doing to your intimacy, your trust, your future
- **THE SPECIFIC TRIGGERS** that activate the cycle (extracted from YOUR answers)
- **THE EXACT SCRIPTS** to interrupt the pattern and reset the dynamic

## VALUE STACK (Core Offer Breakdown)

### 📊 Component 1: YOUR PERSONALIZED RELATIONSHIP ANALYSIS

**What You Get:**

#### **The 5 Core Dimensions Analysis**
Your relationship scored across:
- Communication: {{COMM_SCORE}}%
- Trust & Safety: {{TRUST_SCORE}}%
- Sex & Intimacy: {{INTIMACY_SCORE}}%
- Fairness & Balance: {{FAIRNESS_SCORE}}%
- Shared Future: {{FUTURE_SCORE}}%

**What This Means For You:**

You'll FINALLY see which dimension is killing the others. (Spoiler: It's rarely the one you think.)

Most people think their problem is sex. Then they discover their sex problem is actually a trust problem. Or a power imbalance problem. Or an unspoken resentment problem.

**The scores show you WHERE the real damage is happening.**

**Why You Need This:**

You can't fix what you can't measure. And you can't prioritize when everything feels equally broken.

These numbers cut through the fog.

---

#### **Future Forecast (6-Month + 5-Year Predictions)**

**What You Get:**

A clinical prediction of where your relationship is headed if nothing changes.

**Example 6-Month Forecast:**  
*"Without intervention, comfort will calcify into resentment. The weekly conflicts will either intensify or numb into indifference."*

**Example 5-Year Forecast:**  
*"In 5 years, you risk becoming true roommates—sharing logistics but not a life. The absence of touch, shared dreams, and emotional responsiveness will compound. You may wake up one day and realize you've built a life together without building a relationship."*

**What This Means For You:**

No more "Should I stay or should I go?"

You'll know if you're on a path toward reconnection or slow erosion.

**Why You Need This:**

Time is the one resource you can't get back.

If this relationship is going to end, wouldn't you rather know NOW than waste another 5 years hoping it gets better?

And if it's FIXABLE, you need to know WHAT to fix and HOW MUCH TIME you have.

---

#### **Narcissism & Toxicity Screen (Abuse Risk Assessment)**

**What You Get:**

- **Abuse Risk Level:** 0-100 scale
- **Toxicity Index:** Clinical assessment
- **Red Flags Detected:** Gaslighting, emotional manipulation, Cluster B traits

**What This Means For You:**

You'll know if you're walking on eggshells because of YOUR anxiety or because of THEIR manipulation.

This is the difference between:
- "We need to work on our communication" (healthy relationship)
- "I need to get out" (abusive relationship)

**Why You Need This:**

People in toxic relationships doubt their own perception.

*"Am I overreacting? Am I too sensitive? Maybe it's just me."*

**This assessment removes the doubt.**

If your Toxicity Index is 71-100, you're not overreacting. You need to prioritize safety.

And the report will tell you that—clearly, clinically, with no ambiguity.

---

#### **The Complete Pattern Breakdown (Your Exact Cycle)**

**What You Get:**

The step-by-step cycle of YOUR specific conflict pattern.

**Example:**
*"The cycle works like this: A tension point emerges (mismatched desire, lack of touch, diverging life paths). Instead of one partner pursuing and the other withdrawing, you BOTH withdraw. You both avoid the conversation. Days pass. The tension doesn't resolve—it just gets buried. Then something similar happens again, and you both retreat again. This pattern is so smooth that it feels like you have no conflict, but you actually have constant unresolved tension."*

**What This Means For You:**

You'll finally UNDERSTAND why the same fight happens every Tuesday.

It's not personal. It's not because you hate each other or you're incompatible.

**It's a SYSTEM. And systems can be changed.**

**Why You Need This:**

Once you see the pattern, you can interrupt it.

Before this, you were fighting the PERSON.  
Now, you're fighting the PATTERN.

That changes everything.

---

#### **Specific Triggers (Personalized to YOUR Relationship)**

**What You Get:**

3 concrete triggers extracted from your answers.

**Example Triggers:**
- *"Sexual desire mismatch—one of you wants significantly more, but neither addresses it directly"*
- *"Lack of affectionate touch—you strongly disagree that you touch often (Score: 1), but you're not discussing why"*
- *"Diverging life goals—you disagree you're growing in different directions (Score: 2), but you also disagree your goals are aligned (Score: 2)"*

**What This Means For You:**

You'll PREDICT when the fight is coming—and interrupt it before it starts.

Instead of getting blindsided by another blowup, you'll think:

*"Ah. We're about to have the money conversation. I know this is a trigger. Let me use the de-escalation script from the guides."*

**Why You Need This:**

Prevention beats repair.

Most couples spend 90% of their energy trying to recover from fights.

**What if you could prevent 80% of them?**

---

#### **The 12 Advanced "Vital Signs"**

**What You Get:**

Deeper psychological metrics that reveal hidden dynamics:

1. **Crystal Ball** (Sustainability Forecast) - {{SUSTAINABILITY}}%
2. **Bounce Back** (Repair Efficiency) - {{REPAIR}}%
3. **Open Door** (Betrayal Vulnerability) - {{BETRAYAL}}%
4. **Parent-Trap** (Erotic Death Spiral) - {{EROTIC_DEATH}}%
5. **Tactical Truce** (Duty Sex Index) - {{DUTY_SEX}}%
6. **Office Manager** (CEO vs Intern Gap) - {{CEO_INTERN}}%
7. **Quiet Quit** (Silent Divorce Risk) - {{SILENT_DIVORCE}}%
8. **Soulmate Sync** (Compatibility Quotient) - {{COMPATIBILITY}}%
9. **Enemy Within** (Internalized Malice) - {{MALICE}}%
10. **Burnout Rate** (Nervous System Load) - {{BURNOUT}}%
11. **Hidden Spark** (Erotic Potential) - {{EROTIC_POTENTIAL}}%
12. **Anchor Score** (Resilience Battery) - {{RESILIENCE}}%

**What This Means For You:**

These aren't just numbers—they're diagnostic tools.

**Example:**
- If your **Erotic Death Spiral** is 68% BUT your **Hidden Spark** is 70%, it means: *The attraction is still there, but it's buried under resentment and mental load.*
- If your **Betrayal Vulnerability** is 72%, it means: *Unmet needs are creating an opening for emotional or physical affairs.*

**Why You Need This:**

This is the "PhD-level" insight that therapists charge €150/session to uncover.

You're getting it for €47.

---

#### **Connecting The Dots (Cross-Dimensional Insights)**

**What You Get:**

How your problems are connected.

**Example:**
*"Your avoidance of difficult conversations is directly connected to your unclear vision. You disagree your goals are aligned (Score: 2), but you're not discussing what you actually want. This means you can't resolve the desire mismatch, can't rebuild touch, and can't reconnect—because you don't know if you're even building the same relationship."*

**What This Means For You:**

You don't have 5 separate problems.

**You have 2 patterns causing 5 symptoms.**

Fix the root, and the symptoms disappear.

**Why You Need This:**

This is the insight that changes EVERYTHING.

Most people attack symptoms forever (more date nights! more sex! more communication!)

**But if the ROOT is a power imbalance or a vision misalignment, those tactics won't work.**

This section shows you the ROOT.

---

#### **Exact Conversation Scripts (Tailored to YOUR Pattern)**

**What You Get:**

Word-for-word scripts for YOUR specific conflict triggers.

**Example Script:**
*"I've realized we haven't actually talked about what we're building together. I want to understand what you want from our life in the next 5 years. Not logistically—what do you want to FEEL? What do you want US to be?"*

**What This Means For You:**

No more "I don't know what to say."

You have the EXACT words.

**Why You Need This:**

Most fights escalate because we don't have language for our emotions.

We say: *"You never help!"* when we mean: *"I feel invisible and exhausted."*

**These scripts give you that language.**

---

#### **30-Day Reconnection Calendar**

**What You Get:**

Week-by-week roadmap based on YOUR biggest issue.

**Example:**
- **Week 1:** Have the vision conversation (Script provided)
- **Week 2:** Address the desire mismatch (Script provided)
- **Week 3:** Rebuild physical touch (Daily micro-actions)
- **Week 4:** Check-in and course-correct

**What This Means For You:**

You know WHAT to do and WHEN to do it.

No guessing. No "where do we even start?"

**Why You Need This:**

Overwhelm kills action.

When everything feels broken, you freeze.

**This calendar breaks it into 4 manageable steps.**

### Guide #1: "The Covert Narcissist Detection Manual: 21 Red Flags You Can't Ignore"
**Value: €19**

**What You Get:**

21-point checklist to identify narcissistic patterns (focusing on COVERT narcissism—the hardest to detect).

**Why Covert Is More Dangerous:**

- 13-17: High probability narcissist

**Value: €17**

**What You Get:**

A logical, emotion-free framework for making THE hardest relationship decision.

**The 4 Relationship States:**

1. **Healthy** (minor issues, willing partners)
2. **Fixable** (serious issues but both trying)
3. **Stagnant** (not bad enough to leave, not good enough to stay)

**The Decision Matrix:**

**Quadrant 1: Stay + Work**
- Both willing to change
- Love still exists
- Shared vision intact
- No abuse present

**Quadrant 2: Stay + Accept**

### Guide #5: "The Mental Load Equalizer: How to Stop Being the Relationship Manager (And Why It's Killing Your Desire)"
**Value: €19**

**What You Get:**

How to rebalance the invisible labor that's destroying your connection.

**What Mental Load Actually Is:**

Not just chores. It's:
- Remembering (appointments, birthdays, tasks)
- Planning (meals, trips, social calendar)
- Anticipating (what needs to happen before it's urgent)
- Worrying (about future logistics)

**The Manager-Employee Dynamic:**

**The Manager (often one partner):**
- Tracks everything
- Reminds constantly
- Plans ahead
- Feels exhausted

**The Employee (often the other):**
- Waits for instructions
- Does tasks when asked
- Doesn't anticipate
- Seems oblivious

**Why This Kills Desire:**

You can't be attracted to someone you parent.

Erotic polarity requires equals—not a boss and subordinate.

**The Equalization Protocol:**

**Step 1: Audit Current Load**
- List every recurring task/responsibility
- Note who "owns" it (not just who does it)

**Step 2: Divide Ownership**
- Each person takes FULL ownership of specific areas
- No reminding allowed
- If it's theirs, they manage it

**Step 3: Failure Protocol**
- When they drop their ball: LET IT DROP
- Don't rescue
- Natural consequences teach

**Step 4: Check-In (Monthly)**
- What's working?
- What needs adjustment?
- Resentment check

**Real Examples:**

**Example 1 (Both partners work full-time):**
- Partner A owns: Meal planning, grocery shopping, kids' school logistics
- Partner B owns: Household maintenance, car stuff, finances

**Example 2 (One works, one home):**
- Working partner: Finances, home repairs, car
- Home partner: Meal planning, kid logistics, social calendar
- Shared: Emotional labor, relationship maintenance

**Why You Need This:**

If your report shows high CEO vs Intern Gap (58%+), mental load imbalance is killing your relationship.

**This guide gives you the system to fix it.**

## SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

### Headline
**"What Others Discovered About Their Relationship"**

---

### Testimonial 1: The Pattern Recognition

> *"I did it alone after another fight where they shut themselves in the bedroom. When I read 'Pursuer-Shutdown Cycle' I had this lightbulb moment—I finally understood why it always ended the same way. I showed them the report a week later, when I was ready to talk without blame. Knowing WHAT was happening gave me the calm to approach it differently."*
> 
> **— Sarah, 34, living together for 5 years**

---

### Testimonial 2: Saved Therapy Time

> *"I didn't want it to sound like an accusation. When we went to therapy later, I brought the report and the therapist said 'usually it takes 4-5 sessions just to understand the pattern, you've already done the work'. Taking the test first saved money and gave me the right words."*
> 
> **— Mark, 41, married for 12 years**

---

### Testimonial 3: Dead Bedroom Revival

> *"We hadn't had sex in 8 months. I read the Dead Bedroom guide and realized we were both waiting to 'feel desire' instead of creating it. The sensate focus exercises felt awkward at first, but by week 6 we were actually connecting again. Not just physically—emotionally."*
> 
> **— David, 38, together for 10 years**

---

### Testimonial 4: Manager Dynamic Identified

> *"The 'Manager-Employee dynamic' section pissed me off because it was EXACTLY us. I printed that page and left it where they'd see it. Two days later they said 'is this really how you feel?' We divided up the mental load that week. Three months later, I actually want them again."*
> 
> **— Alessa, 42, married for 15 years**

---

### Testimonial 5: Narcissism Clarity

> *"The Narcissist Detection guide scored my partner at 18/21. I'd been doubting myself for years. Seeing it laid out clinically—no emotion, just facts—gave me permission to leave. I'm out now and rebuilding."*
> 
> **— James, 36, dated for 4 years**

---

### Stats Bar

📊 **52,847 couples analyzed**

## VALUE COMPARISON SECTION

### Headline
**"Why €47? (And Why It's Actually Worth €1,500+)"**

### Comparison Table

| What You're Comparing | Cost | Time | What You Get |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Couples Therapy** | €150/session × 10 = **€1,500** | 10 weeks | Depends on therapist quality |
| **Self-Help Books** | €20 × 5 = **€100** | 20+ hours reading | Generic advice, not YOUR pattern |
| **Relationship Coach** | €200/session × 5 = **€1,000** | 5 sessions | Personalized but expensive |
| **Online Course** | **€97-€297** | 8+ hours video | General frameworks, not specific to you |
| **This Complete Analysis** | **€47** | **Instant** | **Personalized to YOUR answers + 5 Guides + Actionable scripts** |

### Reframe Copy

This isn't just a "report."

**It's the roadmap therapists spend 4-5 sessions creating.**

It's the pattern you've been trying to name for months (maybe years).

It's the conversation scripts you've been improvising badly.

It's the answer to "Should I stay or go?"

It's 52,847 relationship patterns analyzed and applied to YOUR specific situation.

**For the price of a dinner you'll both scroll through on your phones.**

---

## FAQ SECTION (Objection Handling)

### "Can't I just figure this out on my own?"

**Short answer: You've been trying. That's why you took the test.**

The problem isn't intelligence—it's perspective.

**You can't read the label from inside the bottle.**

You're too close to your own relationship to see the pattern objectively.

This analysis gives you the outside view—the clinical perspective that cuts through emotions and shows you the STRUCTURE.

---

### "What if my partner refuses to read it?"

**47% of our users never show it to their partner.**

They use it to:
- Understand the pattern for themselves
- Change their OWN behavior (which changes the system)
- Decide whether to stay or leave with CLARITY

**Your partner doesn't need to participate for this to work.**

One person CAN shift the dynamic. The guides show you how.

---

### "What if it tells me something I don't want to hear?"

**Then you NEED to hear it.**

The worst thing isn't a painful truth.

**The worst thing is wasting 5 more years on a comfortable lie.**

Look: You already KNOW something is wrong. That's why you took the test.

The analysis doesn't create problems—it NAMES them.

And once you can name it, you can fix it. Or you can leave with clarity instead of guilt.

Both outcomes are wins—because both are INFORMED decisions.

**Plus: 30-Day Money-Back Guarantee.**

If you read it and regret it, full refund. No questions.

---

### "Is this therapy?"

**No. This is triage.**

Therapy requires:
1. Finding a good therapist (weeks)
2. Scheduling (weeks)
3. Building rapport (sessions 1-3)
4. Identifying the pattern (sessions 4-6)
5. Working on the pattern (sessions 7-20)

**This analysis skips steps 1-4.**

You get the pattern identification INSTANTLY.

Then you can:
- **Use it BEFORE therapy** (so you know what to focus on)
- **Use it INSTEAD of therapy** (if you can't afford €150/session)
- **Use it WITH therapy** (therapists LOVE when clients come prepared)

Think of it as: **Self-diagnosis before you see the doctor.**

---

### "What if I'm the problem?"

**The analysis will tell you.**

And honestly? That's the most empowering discovery possible.

**Because you can control YOUR behavior.**

You can't control your partner. But you CAN control:
- How you respond to their withdrawal
- Whether you keep overfunctioning
- How you communicate your needs
- Whether you stay or leave

Most people discover they're BOTH part of the problem—one pattern triggering another.

**That's actually good news. It means you can BOTH fix it.**

---

### "Can this really be done by AI? Isn't human psychology too complex?"

**Fair question. Here's the truth:**

The AI isn't REPLACING human psychology—it's APPLYING it at scale.

**The frameworks come from:**
- **Attachment Theory** (Bowlby, Ainsworth) - 70 years of research
- **Gottman Method** (John Gottman) - 40 years, 3,000+ couples studied
- **Emotionally Focused Therapy** (Sue Johnson) - Evidence-based couples therapy
- **Narcissistic Abuse Screening** (DSM-5 Cluster B criteria) - Clinical diagnostic standards

**The AI doesn't invent new psychology.**

It pattern-matches YOUR answers against 52,847 analyzed relationships and applies these clinical frameworks.

Think of it like this:

*"If a therapist analyzed 52,000 couples and saw the same patterns repeat, what would they learn?"*

**That's what you're getting—52,000 couples worth of pattern recognition applied to YOUR specific situation.**

The AI does in 10 seconds what would take a human therapist 4-5 sessions.

---

### "What if we're 'too far gone'?"

**If you're asking this question, you're not too far gone.**

"Too far gone" is when:
- You feel RELIEF when they're not around (not just exhausted—RELIEF)
- You've completely emotionally detached
- You're actively planning your exit and just waiting for logistics

If you're still ASKING "Is it fixable?", that means part of you still hopes it is.

**This analysis will tell you the truth:**

Your **Sustainability Forecast** will show you if your current trajectory leads to growth or erosion.

Your **Silent Divorce Risk** will show you if you've emotionally checked out.

Your **Resilience Battery** will show you if you have enough shared history to weather this.

**And then YOU decide.**

Stay with clarity. Leave with clarity. But stop living in limbo.
