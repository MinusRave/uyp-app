# Should I Stay or Should I Go?
## The Clinical Decision Matrix (No More Guessing)

---

## Introduction: You're Stuck in the Worst Place

**Not bad enough to leave.**

**Not good enough to stay.**

You're in **limbo**—the most painful relationship state.

**What limbo feels like:**

- Some days you think: *"I can make this work"*
- Other days you think: *"I need to leave"*
- Most days you think: *"I don't know"*

**Why limbo is torture:**

Because you can't plan.

You can't move forward.

You can't grieve.

You're frozen.

**This guide will get you UNSTUCK.**

Not by telling you what to do—but by giving you a **FRAMEWORK** to make the decision yourself.

---

## Part 1: Why You Can't Decide

### Reason #1: Sunk Cost Fallacy

**What it is:**

*"I've already invested 5/10/15 years. I can't throw that away."*

**Why it's a trap:**

Past investment is IRRELEVANT to future happiness.

**The truth:**

Time already spent doesn't justify MORE time wasted.

**Reframe:**

*"If I met them TODAY, knowing what I know now, would I choose this relationship?"*

If the answer is NO, the years already invested don't matter.

---

### Reason #2: Fear of Being Alone

**What it is:**

*"What if I never find someone else?"*

*"What if I die alone?"*

*"What if I'm making a mistake?"*

**Why it's a trap:**

Fear-based decisions create resentment.

**The truth:**

Being ALONE is better than being LONELY in a relationship.

**Stats:**

- 85% of people who leave unhappy relationships say: *"I should have left sooner"*
- Most find new partners within 2 years
- Even those who don't report being HAPPIER alone

**Reframe:**

*"Am I staying because I love them, or because I'm scared?"*

---

### Reason #3: Hope They'll Change

**What it is:**

*"If I just give them more time..."*

*"If I just love them harder..."*

*"If I just explain it better..."*

**Why it's a trap:**

Hope keeps you trapped for YEARS.

**The truth:**

If they wanted to change, they would have by now.

**Test:**

How long have you been hoping they'll change?

- 6 months? Keep trying.
- 1 year? Set a deadline.
- 2+ years? They're not changing.

**Reframe:**

*"Am I in love with WHO THEY ARE, or WHO I HOPE THEY'LL BECOME?"*

---

### Reason #4: Guilt

**What it is:**

*"They need me."*

*"They'll be devastated."*

*"What about the kids?"*

*"I made a commitment."*

**Why it's a trap:**

Guilt is NOT a reason to stay.

**The truth:**

- You're not responsible for their happiness
- Kids are better with separated happy parents than together miserable ones
- Commitment works both ways—are THEY honoring it?

**Reframe:**

*"Am I staying out of love or out of guilt?"*

---

## Part 2: The 4 Relationship States

Every relationship falls into one of these categories.

**Figure out which one you're in.**

---

### State 1: HEALTHY (Stay + Enjoy)

**Characteristics:**

✓ Conflict exists but is resolved constructively
✓ Both partners are emotionally available
✓ Sex life is satisfying to both
✓ You feel supported, loved, respected
✓ Growth is happening (individually and together)
✓ Trust is intact
✓ You're building toward a shared future

**Minor issues present:**

- Occasional arguments (normal)
- Different communication styles (workable)
- Stress from external factors (job, kids, money)

**But the foundation is solid.**

**Decision:**

**STAY.**

Use the communication guides to fine-tune.

---

### State 2: FIXABLE (Stay + Work)

**Characteristics:**

⚠️ Serious issues present BUT:
- Both partners acknowledge the problems
- Both are willing to work on it
- No abuse, no affairs (or affair is disclosed + being addressed)
- Love still exists underneath the hurt
- There's a shared vision (just need to reconnect)

**Examples of fixable issues:**

- Dead bedroom (both willing to try revival protocol)
- Communication breakdown (both willing to learn scripts)
- Resentment (both willing to address and forgive)
- Power imbalance (both willing to rebalance)
- Loss of connection (both willing to prioritize reconnection)

**Key factor:**

**BOTH** partners are willing.

**Decision:**

**STAY + WORK.**

- Set a timeline (6-12 months)
- Weekly therapy
- Use the guides actively
- Reassess at end of timeline

**If progress is happening:** Stay.

**If nothing changes:** Leave.

---

### State 3: STAGNANT (The Limbo Zone)

**Characteristics:**

⚠️ This is where YOU are right now.

- Not terrible (no abuse, no affairs)
- But not GOOD either
- Roommate syndrome
- Emotional disconnection
- Dead or dying sex life
- Going through motions
- No growth, just maintenance
- Not fighting because you've both checked out

**The trap:**

It's COMFORTABLE.

Not happy. But not miserable enough to leave.

**Why this is dangerous:**

You can stay here for DECADES.

Wake up at 60 and realize you wasted your life.

**Decision:**

**You have 90 days to move to State 2 (Fixable) or State 4 (Toxic/Leave).**

Use the 90-Day Test (Part 4).

If nothing changes in 90 days, **you have your answer.**

---

### State 4: TOXIC (Leave)

**Characteristics:**

❌ One or more of these present:

**Abuse (emotional, physical, financial, sexual):**
- Gaslighting, manipulation, control

- Financial control
- Sexual coercion

**Active affairs (emotional or physical):**
- Cheating with no remorse

### TOTAL SCORE INTERPRETATION

**Add up all your points.**

---

Your relationship is fundamentally solid.

**Decision: STAY.**

Minor issues are normal. Use the guides to fine-tune communication and connection.

**Decision: STAY + WORK (with 6-12 month timeline).**

**Action plan:**

1. Weekly couples therapy
2. Individual therapy for both

Give it 90 days of GENUINE effort.

If nothing changes, **leave.**

---

#### 41+ Points: STATE 4 (TOXIC)

This relationship is harming you.

**Decision: LEAVE.**

Especially if you scored high in:
- Safety/Abuse category
- Trust/Betrayal category
- Effort (they're not willing)

See "Toxic Relationship Survival Kit" for exit protocol.

---

## Part 4: The 90-Day Test (For State 3 - Stagnant)

**If you're in limbo, this test gives you CLARITY.**

---

### How It Works

**You commit to 90 days of GENUINE effort.**

Not half-assing. Not "I tried."

**Full, documented effort.**

At the end of 90 days:
- Either progress is visible (move to State 2)
- Or nothing changed (move to State 4 - Leave)

**No more limbo.**

---

### Week 1-2: State Your Needs Clearly

**This is THE most important step.**

Most people in stagnant relationships have NEVER clearly stated their needs.

They've hinted. Implied. Hoped.

**But never SAID.**

**Your task:**

Sit down with your partner and say:

*"I need to be honest about where I am. I'm not happy in our relationship. I've been thinking about leaving. But before I make that decision, I want to give us 90 days to see if we can fix this. Here's what I need from you:"*

**Then list 3-5 SPECIFIC, MEASURABLE needs.**

**Examples:**

❌ Vague: *"I need more emotional connection"*

✓ Specific: *"I need us to have one 30-minute conversation each week where we share how we're feeling, without distractions."*

---

❌ Vague: *"I need you to help more"*

✓ Specific: *"I need you to take full ownership of dinner planning and cooking 3 nights per week, without me reminding you."*

---

❌ Vague: *"I need intimacy"*

✓ Specific: *"I need us to rebuild physical touch. That means daily 20-second hugs and attempting sex at least twice a month."*

---

**Write them down.**

Give your partner a copy.

**This is your CONTRACT.**

---

### Week 3-8: Execute & Document

**Your tasks:**

1. **Follow the protocols** (communication scripts, dead bedroom revival, mental load rebalance)
2. **Document progress** (journal daily)
3. **Weekly check-ins** (How's it going? What's working? What's not?)

**Their tasks:**

1. **Honor the needs you stated**
2. **Engage in therapy** (if that was one of your needs)
3. **Show genuine effort**

**What to track:**

- Are they doing what you asked?
- Are they doing it WILLINGLY or resentfully?
- Is anything changing in how you feel?
- Are you seeing GROWTH or just compliance?

---

### Week 9-12: Reassess

**Sit down at Day 90 and ask:**

**1. Did they honor your needs?**

- Yes, consistently → Progress
- Sometimes, inconsistently → Not enough
- No, barely tried → No change

**2. Do you feel DIFFERENT?**

- Yes, I feel more connected/hopeful → Progress
- Somewhat, but still unsure → Not enough
- No, I still feel the same → No change

**3. Can you see a FUTURE now?**

- Yes, I can imagine us happy together → Progress
- Maybe, if things keep improving → Borderline
- No, I still can't see it → No change

---

### Decision Time: Stay or Go?

**If PROGRESS was made:**

→ **STAY** and continue working (commit to another 6 months of active effort)

---

**If NO CHANGE:**

→ **LEAVE.**

You gave it a fair shot.

They either:
- Didn't try (they don't care enough)
- Tried but nothing changed (incompatibility)

**Either way: You have your answer.**

**LEAVE.**

---

## Part 5: When Leaving Is the RIGHT Choice

**Leaving doesn't mean you failed.**

**Sometimes leaving is the BRAVE choice.**

---

### Scenario 1: They Refuse to Try

**What it looks like:**

You state your needs clearly.

They:
- Dismiss them: *"You're being dramatic"*
- Deflect: *"What about what I need?"*
- Refuse: *"I'm not doing therapy"*
- Ignore: Nothing changes

**Decision:**

If they won't even TRY, **leave.**

You can't fix a relationship alone.

---

### Scenario 2: They Try But Nothing Changes

**What it looks like:**

They go to therapy.

They say the right things.

But BEHAVIOR doesn't change.

**Example:**

- They promise to help with mental load → Still don't
- They promise to work on intimacy → Still refuse sex
- They promise to stop lying → Catch them lying again

**Decision:**

If behavior doesn't match words after 6-12 months, **leave.**

Intention isn't enough. You need CHANGE.

---

### Scenario 3: You've Grown Apart

**What it looks like:**

You want kids. They don't.

You want monogamy. They want open relationship.

You want to live in the city. They want rural.

**These aren't fixable with therapy.**

**Decision:**

**Fundamental incompatibility is a valid reason to leave.**

You can love someone and still be WRONG for each other.

---

### Scenario 4: You're Just Done

**What it looks like:**

You've tried everything.

Therapy. Scripts. Protocols.

And you're just... DONE.

You don't hate them.

You're just exhausted.

**Decision:**

**Being DONE is enough.**

You don't need a "good enough" reason.

*"I don't want this anymore"* is a complete sentence.

---

### Scenario 5: You Feel Relief When You Think About Leaving

**What it looks like:**

You imagine leaving and you feel:
- Lighter
- Freer
- Excited
- Hopeful

(Not sad, not scared—RELIEVED)

**Decision:**

**Your body is telling you to leave.**

Listen.

---

## Part 6: When Staying Is the RIGHT Choice

**Staying isn't "giving up."**

**Sometimes staying is the brave choice too.**

---

### Stay If:

✓ **Both of you are genuinely trying**

Not just talking about it. DOING IT.

Therapy. Scripts. Protocols. Change.

---

✓ **Progress is visible**

Maybe slow. But HAPPENING.

You feel more connected now than 3 months ago.

---

✓ **Love still exists**

Not just attachment. Not just habit.

Real love, affection, care.

---

✓ **You can see a future**

When you imagine 5 years from now, you see:
- Growth
- Connection
- Happiness

---

✓ **The foundation is solid**

You have:
- Trust (or you're rebuilding it and it's working)
- Respect
- Shared values
- Compatible life goals

---

✓ **You WANT to stay**

Not out of fear.

Not out of guilt.

Not out of "I've invested too much."

But because you genuinely WANT this.

---

## Part 7: How to Actually Leave (If That's Your Decision)

**You've decided to leave.**

**Now what?**

---

### Step 1: Plan Quietly

**Do NOT announce your decision until you're ready to execute.**

**Why?**

If you tell them too early:
- They might sabotage you financially
- They might escalate emotionally
- They might manipulate you into staying

**First, secure yourself:**

- Separate bank account
- Important documents (passport, birth certificate, etc.)
- Place to stay (friend, family, apartment)
- Legal consultation (if married or kids involved)

**Timeline: 30-90 days of quiet preparation.**

See "Toxic Relationship Survival Kit" for detailed protocol.

---

### Step 2: Tell Them (In a Safe Setting)

**When you're READY (financially, logistically, emotionally):**

Pick:
- Public place (if you fear escalation)
- Or private (if you feel safe)
- When you have TIME (not before work)

**Use this script:**

*"I've made the decision to end our relationship. This isn't a negotiation or a discussion. I've thought about this carefully, and I'm leaving. I'll be moving out [date]. I'm sorry, but this is final."*

**What NOT to say:**

❌ *"Maybe we can try again someday"* (false hope)

❌ *"It's not you, it's me"* (dishonest)

❌ *"I still love you"* (confusing)

**Keep it clear, kind, and FINAL.**

---

### Step 3: Expect Them to Try to Stop You

**They will:**

- Beg: *"Please, I'll change!"*
- Bargain: *"Give me 6 more months!"*
- Guilt: *"After everything I've done for you?"*
- Rage: *"You're going to regret this!"*
- Love-bomb: *"Remember when we were happy?"*

**Your response:**

*"I understand this is painful. My decision is final."*

**Then LEAVE THE ROOM.**

Don't engage. Don't debate. Don't comfort them.

---

### Step 4: No Contact (Or Gray Rock if Kids Involved)

**No Contact:**

If no kids, no shared property:
- Block their number
- Block social media
- No "checking in"
- No "closure" conversations

**Why?**

Every contact resets your healing.

---

**Gray Rock (if you must interact):**

If you have kids or shared property:
- Communicate ONLY about logistics
- Short, boring responses
- No emotion
- No personal details

**Example:**

Them: *"I miss you. Can we talk?"*

Gray Rock: *"This is about the kids. Please stick to that."*

---

### Step 5: Expect Grief (Even Relief Has Grief)

**You WILL feel:**

- Sad
- Guilty
- Lonely
- Scared
- Second-guessing yourself

**This is NORMAL.**

Even if leaving was the right choice, grief is part of it.

**Allow yourself:**

- To cry
- To miss them (you can miss someone and still know you made the right choice)
- To feel the pain

**Get support:**

- Therapy
- Friends
- Family
- Support groups

---

### Step 6: Don't Go Back

**Most people attempt to leave 3-7 times before it sticks.**

**Why?**

Loneliness. Guilt. Hope they've changed.

**But here's the truth:**

If you go back, you've taught them:
*"I don't mean what I say. If you just wait, I'll come back."*

**Next time you try to leave, it will be HARDER.**

**Stay strong.**

---

## Part 8: Living With Your Decision

**Whether you stay or leave, you'll wonder:**

*"Did I make the right choice?"*

**Here's how to know:**

---

### If You STAYED:

**You made the right choice IF:**

- Things are improving (slowly but surely)
- You feel more connected now than 6 months ago
- Both of you are genuinely trying
- You can see a future

**You made the WRONG choice if:**

- Nothing changed
- You're still miserable
- Only you are trying
- You're staying out of fear, not love

**If you made the wrong choice: It's not too late to leave.**

---

### If You LEFT:

**You made the right choice IF:**

- You feel relief (even through the grief)
- You can breathe again
- You're rediscovering yourself
- You don't regret it (even when lonely)

**You made the WRONG choice if:**

- You left impulsively (without trying to fix it first)
- You regret it constantly
- They were willing to change and you didn't let them

**If you made the wrong choice: Reach out. Try again. But only if THEY did the work while you were apart.**

---

## Part 9: Final Framework - The 5 Questions

**If you're STILL unsure, answer these 5 questions:**

---

### Question 1: "If my best friend described MY relationship to me, what would I tell them to do?"

(We give better advice to others than ourselves.)

---

### Question 2: "Am I staying because I love WHO THEY ARE, or WHO I HOPE THEY'LL BECOME?"

(Hope is not a strategy.)

---

### Question 3: "If nothing changed for the next 5 years, could I accept that?"

(If no, you have your answer.)

---

### Question 4: "Am I staying out of love or out of fear?"

(Fear-based decisions breed resentment.)

---

### Question 5: "When I imagine leaving, do I feel relief or dread?"

(Your body knows before your mind does.)

---

## Conclusion: Trust Yourself

**You already know the answer.**

You knew before you started reading this guide.

**This guide didn't tell you what to do.**

It gave you PERMISSION to trust what you already know.

**If you're meant to stay:**

You'll feel it. Deep down, underneath the doubt, you WANT to fight for this.

**If you're meant to leave:**

You'll feel it. That whisper that says: *"This isn't it."*

**Either way:**

Make a DECISION.

The limbo is killing you.

**Choose.**

And then commit to that choice for at least 90 days.

**Stay or go.**

**But CHOOSE.**
