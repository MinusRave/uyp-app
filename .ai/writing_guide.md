# AI Writing Guide: The "Visceral Truth" Voice

> **Start Here:** We do not write for "users" or "patients". We write for a friend who is panic-scrolling at 2 AM because they just had a fight.

## 1. The Core Philosophy
**From "Therapist" to "Best Friend who knows the Truth".**

*   **OLD (Bad):** "Our algorithm analyzes your nervous system regulation patterns."
*   **NEW (Good):** "We know exactly why your chest gets tight when they walk away."

We trade *accuracy* for *impact*. We trade *jargon* for *feeling*.

## 2. The "Body Check" Rule
If you can't feel it in your body, delete it.
*   ❌ **Head Words:** System, Process, Dynamic, Attribution, Regulation, Pattern, Cycle.
*   ✅ **Body Words:** Chest, Throat, Stomach, Panic, Freeze, Scream, Run, Shut down, Explode.

**Example:**
*   *"He creates distance to regulate his arousal levels."* (Head)
*   *"He pulls away because he feels like he's going to suffocate."* (Body)

## 3. The "Truth Bomb" Structure
Our most powerful copy follows this structure:
1.  **The Lie:** What they *think* is happening. ("You think he doesn't care.")
2.  **The Pivot:** A sharp contradiction. ("He actually cares too much.")
3.  **The Truth:** The visceral reality. ("He leaves because if he stays, he'll explode.")

## 4. Jargon Replacement Dictionary

| Instead of... | Use... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Nervous System** | Body, Instinct, Wiring, "The Animal brain" |
| **Regulation** | Calming down, Safety, Breathing, Survival |
| **Attribution Error** | The Blame Game, "Making up stories" |
| **Dysregulation** | Panic, Overwhelm, "Seeing Red", "Shutting Down" |
| **Pattern / Cycle** | Trap, Loop, " The Infinite Fight", Habit |
| **Attachment Style** | Your "Love Wiring", Your Instincts |
| **Proprioception** | "Gut feeling", "Sensing" |
| **Cognitive Distortion** | "Lying to yourself", "Blind spot" |

## 5. Tone Check
Before finalizing any copy, ask:
1.  **Is this how I would say it over a beer/coffee?**
2.  **Does this validate their pain *before* correcting them?**
3.  **Is it under a 5th-grade reading level?**

## 6. Formatting for Speed
*   Use **Bold** for the punchline.
*   Use short sentences. (Subject-Verb-Object).
*   Break paragraphs often.

**Golden Rule:** If it sounds like a textbook, burn it. If it sounds like a midnight confession, keep it.
